# Loan Default Prediction

This project aims to build a predictive model that identifies the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan. By analyzing historical financial and demographic data, the model helps financial institutions make informed lending decisions and reduce credit risk.

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Predict loan default risk based on borrower data.
- Improve decision-making for loan approvals.
- Provide interpretable insights to support financial analysis.

## 🧠 Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering and selection
- Model training using supervised learning algorithms
- Model evaluation using performance metrics
- Interpretability via SHAP or feature importance
- Deployment-ready pipeline (optional)

## 🗃️ Dataset

The dataset includes features such as:

- Loan amount
- Interest rate
- Borrower income
- Credit score
- Loan term
- Employment status
- Default status (target variable)

> 📌 *Note:* Due to privacy or licensing, the dataset may not be included in this repository.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualization
- SHAP for model explainability
- Streamlit / Flask (optional for deployment)

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
